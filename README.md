## Navigating the Repository
This repository has three branches:
1. The [`main`](https://github.com/ian-young/API_Scripts) branch which is where working, production-level code is located.
2. The [`wip`](https://github.com/ian-young/API_Scripts/tree/wip) branch is intended for code that is working but still has features that need to be developed or is in the debugging phase.
3. The [`ideas`](https://github.com/ian-young/API_Scripts/tree/ideas) branch is for any experimental code; this will see a higher volume of commits and not all of the code located here will be working.

>[!TIP] 
>The order of development should start at the lowest branch, `ideas` and work its way up to the prodcution branch, `main`.

### Projects
Scripts that will have a larger impact will have an associated project where issues may be posted and organized for organized development of the script. Items that may be found in project can range from bug reports, documentation requests, feature requests, etc.
