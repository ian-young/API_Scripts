# API_Scripts

This is a private repository where API scripts and projects may live before being published to a different repository. Scripts that are ready to be published are found within the `main` branch. These scripts may be shared as long as they are located on the `main` branch since the credentials are not hard-coded. When sharing scripts, it is important to remember to send over the [requirements.txt](/requirements.txt) file and the [.env-generic](/.env-generic) file to give the user a base to work from. For more detailed information, please visit this repository's [Wiki](https://github.com/ian-young/API_Scripts/blob/main/Wiki/Home.md)

>[!IMPORTANT]
>When sending the `.env-generic` file over, it is important to remember to mention that the name needs to be changed to `.env` and the file must be in the same directory as the script for the code to function properly.

The purpose of these scripts is:

* Enhance personal understanding of how to work with API
* Learn best practices when working with API
* Stay up to date with coding skills
  * Continue to learn how to optimize code
  * Experiment with new methods of running code and making calls
* Create automations that may be shared with customers or used on customer orgs

## Navigating the Repository

This repository has two branches:

1. The [`main`](https://github.com/ian-young/API_Scripts) branch which is where working, production-level code is located.
2. Feature branches will be made for each active project in the repository. All branches can be viewed on [this page](https://github.com/verkadase/command-apis/branches).
>[!TIP]
>The order of development should start at the lowest branch, `ideas` and work its way up to the production branch, `main`.

### Projects

Scripts that will have a larger impact will have an associated project where issues may be posted and organized for organized development of the script. Items that may be found in project can range from bug reports, documentation requests, feature requests, etc.

There are no current running projects in this repository; all work is caught up!
