# Try Endpoints

## Purpose

This is a Docker container that will run a webserver only allowing traffic coming from `127.0.0.1` (localhost) and will graph the amount of retries (server load) and failed api requests happen. The script will run this test once every 15 minutes and populate the results in the graph.
