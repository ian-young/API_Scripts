# Release Notes

## Upgrade Guide

### Upgrading from Previous Versions

If you're upgrading from a previous version of the **API Scripts** repository, follow these steps to ensure a smooth transition:

1. **Check Compatibility**: Review the release notes and documentation for the new version to understand any compatibility changes or requirements.

2. **Backup Existing Code**: Before making any changes, create backups of your existing code-base to safeguard against potential data loss or unintended modifications.

3. **Update Dependencies**: If the new version includes updates to dependencies or requires new software components, ensure that you update these dependencies accordingly. Use package managers like pip for Python dependencies or npm for JavaScript dependencies.

4. **Review Configuration Changes**: Check for any changes to configuration files or environment variables required by the updated version. Update these configurations as needed to reflect the new requirements.

5. **Test in Staging Environment**: Before deploying the updated version to production, thoroughly test your application in a staging environment to identify and address any issues or regressions.

6. **Deploy Gradually**: If possible, deploy the updated version gradually to minimize downtime and mitigate any potential impact on users. Use strategies like blue-green deployments or canary releases to rollout updates safely.

7. **Monitor Performance and Errors**: Monitor your application's performance and error logs closely after the update to identify any performance bottlenecks or unexpected errors introduced by the new version. Address any issues promptly to ensure a smooth user experience.

8. **Communicate with Stakeholders**: Keep stakeholders informed throughout the upgrade process, providing updates on the progress and any potential impact on service availability or functionality. Address any concerns or questions they may have to maintain transparency and trust.
